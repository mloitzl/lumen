Since I am very lazy programmer I always think about shortening things a little bit.

Instead of writing...

```csharp
Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Web appWeb = siteContext.Web;
siteContext.Load(appWeb);
siteContext.ExecuteQuery();
```

... its worth having a look on the signature of the ```Load``` method:

```csharp
public void Load<T>(T clientObject, params Expression<Func<T, object>>[] retrievals) where T : ClientObject;
```

It turns out that I can save one line of code every time by declaring an extension method like...

```csharp
public static void LoadAndExecute<T>(
  this Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.ClientContext me,
  T clientObject,
  params System.Linq.Expressions.Expression<Func<T, object>>[] retrievals) 
         where T : Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.ClientObject
  {
    me.Load(clientObject, retrievals);
    me.ExecuteQuery();
  }
```

which simplifies the above code to:

```csharp
Microsoft.SharePoint.Client.Web appWeb = siteContext.Web;
siteContext.LoadAndExecute(appWeb);
```

One line saved...
