Since literally everbody I know is currently working on a cloud@home project in some form I also decided to start working a long planned project: a portable kubernetes cluster. 

And also a former [colleague](https://sandrofelder.ch/building-your-own-private-cloud-with-raspberry-pi-4-and-kubernetes/) gave me the last push for it - thanks ðŸ˜‰

# Portability

Currently, portability means, that only 2 cables - power and network - are connected.

A later addition I am planning is attaching the cluster to a mobile router. The question ist, if the POE switch can deliver the necessary additional power for this.

And, the 52Pi rack tower has a handle to carry it around - or throw it out of the window - depends on the use case.

This will become a series of articles, lets start with the hardware.

## Dupont Pins on the U6109


The [U6109](https://www.uctronics.com/tools-and-accessories/pi-accessories/poe-hat-for-raspberry-pi-4-uctronics-mini-power-over-ethernet-expansion-board-for-raspberry-pi-4-b-3-b.html) actually has two rows for connectors, mine had no connectors soldered in - unfortunately.

My soldering skills are a little dated, but I took my chances - and it worked out nicely.

Fan and LED connector cables can now easily be attached to the POE powered Raspberry.

Speaking of ventilation: the 52Pi rack tower ventilator is suprisingly quiet, but powerfull - so having it in the same room is not disturbing at all.

![U6110](./U6110.png)

I removed the fan from the [U6110](https://www.uctronics.com/poe-hat-for-raspberry-pi-4-uctronics-mini-power-over-ethernet-expansion-board-for-raspberry-pi-4-b-3-b-with-cooling-fan.html), because they make a quite annoying sound.

## Accessible SD Cards

A quite handy feature of the 52Pi rack tower are the SD card adapters. The card slots would be very hard to reach, when the case is fully assembled.

## Mount the POE Switch

A simple wooden plate with a bunch of holes is connected to the base of the 52Pi rack tower using 4 blue cable ties.

The 2 Screws in the middle are connected the wall-mount recess of the POE Switch.

An acrylic plate would be nice, but I don't have access to a laser-cutter.

## Fully assembled

Looks quite shiny by night ðŸ¤“
