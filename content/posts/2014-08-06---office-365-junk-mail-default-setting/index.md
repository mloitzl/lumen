Office 365 keeps filtering mail from recipients off my contact list in the “Junk E-Mail” folder which is quite annoying.

This behaviour can be changed via the “Settings > Options > Block or Allow”. By default “Trust email from my contacts” is turned off which is not the best choice for this setting.
