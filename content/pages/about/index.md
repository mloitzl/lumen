## Publications

I earned my Master's (Dipl.-Ing.) in 2006. My thesis can be found [here on github](https://github.com/mloitzl/hem/blob/main/133236_loitzl_martin_2006.pdf) and [here at TU Graz](https://diglib.tugraz.at/the-heuristic-evaluation-manager-hem-2006).

In a crazy effort, I tried get my thesis project (php4 and mysql4) back up and running with containers, btw. such a thing didn't exist back then.
Nevertheless, source code and a docker compose environment can be found [here on github](https://github.com/mloitzl/hem/).
